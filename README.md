import the modules then
read the data set then
Inspect the shape of training and testing then
define the model then
Define the weights and biases for each layer of the model then
Initialize all the variables then
Call the defined model then
Define the cost function and optimizer then
Calculate the cost and accuracy for each epoch then
print the final accuracy then
print the final mean square error then
print accuracy run
